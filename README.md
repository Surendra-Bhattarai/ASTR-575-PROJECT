# ASTR-575-PROJECT

Using secondary eclipse to find eccentricity, utilizing the the gap differences between the mid-transit and the two eclipses around the mid-transit.

Proper analysis is completed for WASP-18b.

My other targets include: HAT-P-15b, HAT-P-2b, to name a few...

Since, the notebook is made already, I can just use the same code for analysing the other planets.
